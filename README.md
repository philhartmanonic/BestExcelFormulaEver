# The best excel formula ever made
This is from a project where I needed to build a reporting tool in excel to show results and crosstabs from survey data.
The formula itself is just a small fraction of the work, as it involved creating a pseudo-database within Excel, and several other insane formulas.
But this formula is the coup de grace. 

If you're an Excel nerd - enjoy
